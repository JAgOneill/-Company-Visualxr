So Earlier , before COVID-19 people didnt have problem travlling all over the world  from  city to city , state to state and country to country . Since this pandemic came in picture everyone got locked up in their home to fight the COVID-19 strain and to break this chain . But because of this so many places couldnt audit their stores , not able to see to if their other sub branches are following the same protocol Here I come in picture and solved the issue of auditing by giving loacal chance to earn and audit the store . with this tool stores can audit their premises and get successful result in a secure manner .

### Purpose of this TOOL:
Earlier no system existed to cater to the needs of ‘Secure Infrastructure Implementation System’. The current system developed is technically feasible. It is a web based user interface for audit workflow at NIC-CSD. Thus it provides an easy access to the users. The database’s purpose is to create, establish and maintain a workflow among various entities in order to facilitate all concerned users in their various capacities or roles. Permission to the users would be granted based on the roles specified. Therefore, it provides the technical guarantee of accuracy, reliability and security. The software and hard requirements for the development of this project are not many and are already available in-house at NIC or are available as free as open source. The work for the project is done with the current equipment and existing software technology. Necessary bandwidth exists for providing a fast feedback to the users irrespective of the number of users using the system.



   
### Abstract:
